				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>New COVID-19 cases consistently declined during spring and summer months (April through August), suggesting a recurring seasonal pattern of reduced transmission during warmer periods.</li>
				<li>The rate of new cases rises most sharply around January of each year, with the January 2022 surge far exceeding any prior peak — and given the steep upward trajectory at the time of the visualization, an even higher peak appeared imminent.</li>
				<li>Case counts follow a broadly sinusoidal pattern across all three years, cycling between seasonal peaks and troughs — though the amplitude of each wave varies considerably, with each successive winter surge growing larger than the last.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Final Writeup</h2>

			<p>
        DESCRIBE YOUR RATIONALE TO JUSTIFY THE DECISIONS FOR YOUR FINAL DESIGN.
				WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO CONVEY, AND HOW DOES YOUR DESIGN FACILITATE THIS?
      </p>

			<p>
        REFLECT ON HOW YOUR FINAL DESIGN DOES OR DOES NOT ADDRESS YOUR ORIGINAL CRITIQUE.
				WHAT TENSIONS OR TRADEOFFS DID YOU ENCOUNTER? WHAT DID NOT WORK OUT AS ANTICIPATED?
